# LinkedIn Auto Connect Tool

Sometimes you want more `LinkedIn` connections, especially `500+`. This tool is very helpful to boost up your connections.
Just run it from your favorite terminal or command prompt and keep it running until you make enough connection requests.

> An automation tool to automate the connection requests on LinkedIn.

## Requirements

`node` >= `v8.0.0`

**Note**: If `node` and `npm` are not installed, then Install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Installation

Install this tool using `npm`:

```bash
$ npm install -g linkedin-auto-connect
```

It installs two binaries: `linkedin-auto-connect` and `lac` to your system path.

## Usage

Use it as follows using `lac` command:

```bash
$ lac -u <enter_your_linkedin_email>
Enter LinkedIn password: *****
```

If you want to keep your console clean, then just pass `--no-verbose` option.

**Note**: It does not share your `LinkedIn` credentials, so it is safe to use.
